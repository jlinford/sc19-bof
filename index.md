# Event Summary

Arm-based processors have gained substantial traction in the HPC community. Sandia’s “Astra” is #156 on the Top500, and projects like the Japanese Post-K “Fugaku”, European Mont-Blanc, U.S. DOE Vanguard, and UK GW4/EPSRC are strong proof points. HPC system integrators like Atos, Cray, Gigabyte, and HPE have Arm commercial offerings, but will Arm become an HPC leader? This BoF brings together experts and luminaries to share their experiences with Arm, discuss the remaining technical and ecosystem challenges, consider the role of codesign in HPC, discuss progress, and lay out a vision for the future state of Arm in the HPC community.

## [55min] Panel Discussion

Interactive discussion with leaders in the Arm HPC space.

### Rui Oliveira, _University of Minho, INESC TEC_ 

### Simon McIntosh-Smith, _University of Bristol, GW4_ 

### Mitsuhisa Sato, _RIKEN Center for Computational Science_ 

Sato is deputy director of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science, and Team Leader of the Programming Environment Research Team.  He is also a deputy project leader and the Team Leader of the Architecture Development Team in the FLAGSSHIP 2020 project that developed the "Fugaku" system.

### Andrew Younge, _Sandia National Laboratories_ 

### Dirk Pleiter, _Forschungszentrum Juelich_ 

Dirk Pleiter leads a research group on "Application oriented technology development" at Juelich Supercomputing Centre. He is currently involved in different projects, where Arm technology plays an important role, including EPI and the Open Edge and HPC initiative. His team operates a 16-node cluster based on Hisilicon Hi1616 processors as well as a 4-node cluster based on ThunderX2 processors.

### Keith Obenschain, _U.S. Naval Research Laboratory_ 

### Guillaume Colin de Verdière, _CEA_

Guillaume graduated from ENSCP (Chimie ParisTech) in 1984 and got his PhD in 2019 (subject was: Searching for the highest
performance for simulation codes and scientific visualization). He has been a CEA staff member since 1985. After
contributing to large scientific codes for 7 years, he has been deeply involved in post-processing software with a focus on
visualization and I/O. Since 2008, his activities are on investigating new architectures for next generations of
supercomputers and foresee the impact of such architectures on scientific codes.
